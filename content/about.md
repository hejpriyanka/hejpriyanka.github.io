## From Village Roots to Tech Frontiers

As a first-generation graduate from a small South Indian village, my journey to software engineering has been anything but conventional. Growing up without tech role models, I discovered my passion for problem-solving through math puzzles and logical riddles - skills that now fuel my programming career.

💍 Married to [my wonderful partner](https://linkedin.com/in/krishnapayyavula) (who somehow survives both Swedish winters and my debugging moods), I recently embarked on a new adventure in Stockholm! When I'm not battling the dark Swedish winters, you'll find me:

- 🧩 Solving complex coding challenges (and marital debates about optimal solutions)
- ☁️ Architecting cloud solutions that would make AWS proud
- 🤖 Automating everything from coffee machines to CI/CD pipelines

**Professional Journey Snapshot:**
- 🚀 Led automation projects reducing manual work by 30% at Capgemini
- ✈️ Engineered critical systems for Airbus' digital infrastructure
- 📈 Transformed raw data into strategic insights using Python & Pandas

*(It takes me exactly 3 coffee meetings to transform from shy newcomer to unstoppable chatterbox!)*
